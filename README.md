## Just add the templates or functions you need in your code

**Hello, every competitive programmer üñê**, It occurred to me that many competitors leave a lot of templates and functions in their code to solve problems in contests fast, **but** If there is someone who wants to read your code after that to learn from you or understand the idea of the problem?  Won't he have difficulties?
I think he gets a little annoyed and gets lost between existing templates and functions, **and for that**, I made this repository, **To solve problems in contests fast with clean and ordinary code.**
